    <h1>Ticker Board</h1>
    <p>This will be the landing page for my ticker board plugin.</p>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul class="create-ticker">
      <li>Vanilla JS</li>
      <li>CSS included</li>
      <li>Auto rotating board</li>
      <li>Manual update API</li>
      <li>That's all so far</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's currently not accessible. There's no way a screen reader would have a
      good time reading these, for example. It is compatible with copying to
      clipboard, however.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code lang="javascript">
new TickerBoard('.my-ticker-board')
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This would replace each of the children of any
      <code>.my-ticker-board</code> matching element with a board which
      automatically rotates through the inner text of that board. This is
      exactly how the board above works.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code lang="javascript">
document.getElementById('my-board')
const board = new Board(element)
board.updateMessages(['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'])

board.element.addEventListener('click', )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This would replace each of the children of any
      <code>.my-ticker-board</code> matching element with a board which
      automatically rotates through the inner text of that board. This is
      exactly how the board above works.
